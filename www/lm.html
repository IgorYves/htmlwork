    <h2>Search for internship in Software </h2>
    <p>Development Dear Sir/Madam, Currently training in AFPA of Champs sur
      Marne (Software Developer professional qualification level 2), I am
      looking for a 2-month end-of-course internship beginning on 13 May 2019. </p>
    <p>I am looking especially for projects in Java, but other languages are
      suitable. With a number of years in IT development (both back-end and
      front-end) I have practiced PHP, JavaScript, SQL, HTML and others. I am
      ready to quickly study the technologies used by your team to facilitate
      the beginning of an internship. </p>
    <p>I offer you my analytic capacities, my knowledge in languages and IT
      technologies and my ability to learn and evolve non-stop, and hope very
      much you may be able to use them. </p>
    <p>Yours faithfully</p>
    <p>Yves HUGOT </p>
